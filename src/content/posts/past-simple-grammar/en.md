Past Simple — one of the first and most important tenses learned in English. And for good reason: it allows you to tell stories, share memories, and describe events that have already happened. Let’s break it down, and you’ll see that it’s actually a piece of cake!

## When do we use the Past Simple?

This tense is used to describe actions that started and ended in the past. Here are the main cases:

*   **A completed action at a specific time in the past.**
    *   *“I visited my grandmother **yesterday**.” * —   (The action is finished.).

*   **A sequence of actions in the past (a story).**
    *   *“She **woke up**, **brushed** her teeth, and **made** some coffee.” — (Actions happened one after another.)

*   **Past habits or states that are no longer true.**
    *   *“He **lived** in London for ten years.” — (He doesn’t live there anymore.)

## How is the Past Simple formed?

The most important thing to remember: in the Past Simple, verbs are divided into two groups — **regular** and **irregular**.

*   **Regular verbs::** Just add the **-ed** ending.
    *   `work` → `worked`
    *   `play` → `played`
    *   `ask` → `asked`

*   **Irregular verbs:** These have their own unique forms you must memorize (the second column in the list of irregular verbs).
    *   `go` → `went`
    *   `see` → `saw`
    *   `do` → `did`

Now let’s see how to build sentences.

### Affirmative  (+)

The formula is simple: `Підмет + V2 / V-ed`.

*   *“She **worked** a lot last week.”* (regular verb)
*   *“They **went** to the park.”* (irregular verb)

### Negative  (-)

Here we use the auxiliary verb **did** with **not** (did not or the contraction didn’t).

**Note!** After `didn't`, the main verb always returns to its base form (infinitive without to).

Formula: `Subject  + didn't + V1`.

*   *“She **didn't work** a lot last week.”* (Не `didn't worked`!)
*   *“They **didn't go** to the park.”* (Не `didn't went`!)

### Questions (?)

The auxiliary verb **`did`** goes to the beginning of the sentence. The main verb also stays in its base form.

Formula: `Did + subject  + V1?`

*   *“**Did** you **work** yesterday?”* — *“Yes, I did.” / “No, I didn't.”*
*   *“**Did** they **go** to the park?”* — *“Yes, they did.” / “No, they didn't.”*

## Time markers

These words help you recognize when to use the Past Simple:
*   **yesterday** 
*   **last** week/month/year
*   two days/three years **ago** 
*   **in 1999** 
*   **when I was a child** 

Mastering the Past Simple is a big step toward fluent communication. This tense is the foundation for any story about the past, so give it a bit of attention — and the results will come quickly!
