If you're starting to learn Korean, you've probably already noticed that the same sentence can be said in several different ways. These aren’t just synonyms — they’re part of an entire system of speech levels and politeness styles, which are deeply embedded in Korean culture and language. Understanding this system is key to respectful and appropriate communication.

## Why is it so important?

Korean society has deep roots in Confucian traditions, where respect for elders and social status is a core value. This respect is shown not only through behavior, but also directly through grammar. Choosing the wrong speech level may be perceived as rude or disrespectful, even if you had no bad intentions.

Key factors that affect the choice of speech style:
*   **Age:** Is the person older, younger, or the same age as you?
*   **Social status:** Is it your boss, colleague, subordinate, or client?
*   **Closeness:** Is it a close friend, family member, or a stranger?
*   **Context:** Is it a formal meeting, casual chat, or public speech?

## Main korean speech styles

Although there are more than three speech levels, for everyday life, it's enough to master the main three:

### 1. Informal style (반말 — Banmal)

This is the “casual” or “intimate” way of speaking, used in informal situations.

*   **When to use it:** With close friends (especially peers or younger), siblings, sometimes parents.
*   **How to recognize it:** Sentences often end in **~아/어 (~a/eo)** or just a noun/adjective. The **~요 (~yo)** ending is usually missing.
*   **Example:** “안녕! 밥 먹었어?” (Annyeong! Bap meogeosseo?) — “Hi! Did you eat?”
*   **Important:** Never use banmal with strangers or elders without their permission. It is considered very rude.

### 2. Polite informal style (해요체 — Haeyo-che)

This is the "golden middle" — polite but not overly formal. It’s the most commonly used speech level in daily life.

*   **When to use it:** Almost always! With colleagues, strangers, elders, in shops or cafes. **If you’re unsure which level to use — go with this one.**
*   **How to recognize it:** Sentences end in  **~아요/어요/해요 (~ayo/eoyo/haeyo)**.
*   **Example:** *“안녕하세요! 밥 먹었어요?” (Annyeonghaseyo! Bap meogeosseoyo?)* — “Hello! Have you eaten?”

### 3. Formal polite style (하십시오체 — Hasipsio-che)

This is the most formal and respectful speech style.

*   **When to use it:** In business meetings, presentations, the military, news broadcasts, public announcements, or when maximum respect is needed.
*   **How to recognize it:**  Declarative sentences end in **~ㅂ니다/습니다 (~mnida/seumnida)**, and questions in  **~ㅂ니까/습니까 (~mnikka/seumnikka)**.
*   **Example:** *“안녕하십니까! 식사하셨습니까?” (Annyeonghasimnikka! Siksahasyeosseumnikka?)* — “Greetings! Have you eaten?”

The well-known phrase “감사합니다 (Gamsahamnida)” — “Thank you” — is an example of this level.

## Comparison table

| In Ukrainian | Informal  (Banmal) | Polite informal (Haeyo-che) | Formal polite (Hasipsio-che) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hello** | 안녕 (Annyeong) | 안녕하세요 (Annyeonghaseyo) | 안녕하십니까 (Annyeonghasimnikka) |
| **Thank you** | 고마워 (Gomawo) | 고마워요 (Gomawoyo) | 감사합니다 (Gamsahamnida) |
| **I am a student** | 나는 학생이야 (Naneun haksaeng-iya) | 저는 학생이에요 (Jeoneun haksaeng-ieyo) | 저는 학생입니다 (Jeoneun haksaeng-imnida) |

Learning Korean speech styles may seem complicated at first, but it’s a fascinating journey into the heart of Korean culture. Start with **해요체 (Haeyo-che)**, and you’ll always sound polite. With time and practice, you’ll naturally get a feel for which level suits each situation.
